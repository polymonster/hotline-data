# hotline-data

This repository contains example data and tools for [hotline](https://github.com/polymonster/hotline). It is automatically cloned inside a hotline environement when running `cargo build`.

It bundles [pmbuild](https://github.com/polymonster/pmbuild) and [pmfx](https://github.com/polymonster/pmbuild) in the binary directory to build data and shaders.

And serves source data files in [src_data](https://github.com/polymonster/hotline/src_data) for use in hotline applications or plugins.
